/**
 * CLI handler for `omp ps` — inspect and control processes supervised by the
 * daemon broker from outside the harness.
 *
 * A bare `omp ps` on a TTY opens the interactive alt-screen monitor
 * (`pi-tui/apps/ps-top`); `--plain`, `--json`, and non-TTY outputs use the static
 * listing. Actions (`stop`, `kill`, `restart`, `logs`, `info`) connect through
 * the regular client, which revives a dead broker so it can re-adopt detached
 * daemons before acting on them.
