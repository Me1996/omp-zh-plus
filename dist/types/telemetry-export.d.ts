/**
 * OTLP telemetry export bootstrap.
 *
 * omp's agent core (`@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core`) emits OpenTelemetry GenAI
 * spans through the global `@opentelemetry/api` tracer, and exposes run-level
 * callbacks for metrics/log pipelines. This module resolves the standard
 * `OTEL_*` env contract (endpoint, exporter selection, protocol,
 * `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`) and, only when at least one signal has an OTLP endpoint,
 * loads `./telemetry-export-otlp` to register the trace/log/metric providers —
 * keeping the OTel SDK + exporter module graph (~100ms) out of default startup.
 *
 * Only the `http/protobuf` transport is supported — an
 * `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP*_PROTOCOL` of `grpc` or `http/json` declines rather than
 * misrouting protobuf payloads.
