 * that asked for another, silently serving the wrong configuration from a
 * process the client believed it had configured.

 * Env keys are sorted so object insertion order never splits one identity in
 * two, and the parts are JSON-encoded so no separator can be forged from a
 * value (`["--log-level", "4"]` stays distinct from `["--log-level 4"]`).
 * The canonical identity is SHA-256 hashed because the key is returned over
 * the handshake and included in mux logs; raw environment values can contain
 * credentials and must not leak through either surface.
